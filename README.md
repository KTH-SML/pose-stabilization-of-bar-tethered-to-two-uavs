### Pose stabilization of bar tethered to two uavs

The notebooks, described next, are meant to be read in conjunction with the companion pdf document "pose stabilization of bar tethered to two uavs.pdf".

In the notebook
- "pose stabilization of bar tethered to two uavs.nb" we derive all of the results presented in the pdf (model, controller, and closed-loop analysis) for the different cases specified in the pdf.

In the notebook
- "crane_system/crane_systeml.nb" we provide the model, controller, and closed-loop analysis for a "container-crane"-system, so serve as a comparison to the "bar tethered to two uavs"-system.
